<h1>Box joint jig plans DXF files</h1>
DXF files allow you to view the CAD model in AutoCad,
and some other programs also use DXF.  I have DXF files available
for the plans.
<p>
However, the DXF files are large and few people use them,
so they are not part of the standard download Zip file for use
off-line.  You can however download the DXF files separately.
<p>
<span id="zip">
You are currently browsing the off-line copy of the plans on your computer.
<br>
However, if you click on "Browse plans on-line" from the download page (a link to that
page was emailed to you), then click on "DXF CAD files" from the main index
to download the DXF files separately.

<p>
Sorry, but the DXF files do not include all the gears.  To make DXF files of the gears, use the
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/gear">gear generator program</a>
