<tr><th colspan=2><h3>Wood for the gears</h3>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Use 9 mm or 11 mm birch plywood.  If you buy a sheet 2x4' or larger for the base,
there should be enough material left for quite a few gears.  For each gear, you can calculate the size
of the minimum square blank by the following calculation:<br>
<ul>
Gear size in centimeters = Number of teeth * 0.51 + 1
</ul>
Its a good idea to make the blanks slightly larger than the final gear.<p>
For the 12 tooth gear, the gear is 7.2 cm in diameter.  Use a 8x8 cm blank.<br>
For the 16 tooth gear, the gear is 9.2 cm in diameter.  Use a 10x10 cm blank.<br>
For the 48 tooth gear, the gear is 26.5 cm in diameter.  Use a 27 cm blank.<br>
