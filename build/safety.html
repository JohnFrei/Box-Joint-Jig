<h1>Screw advance box joint jig safety notes</h1>
<p>
Care was taken in the design of this box joint jig, and when properly constructed,
this jig allows box joints to be cut with better safety than with conventional
box joint jigs.
<p>
However, no two shop built jigs will be identical, so performance and safety 
of your jig cannot be guaranteed by woodgears.ca
<p>
It is assumed that the builder is skilled
in woodworking.  This should not be your first woodworking project.
It is also assumed that the builder is already familiar with the safe 
operation of table saws.
<p>
<b>Woodgears.ca cannot be held liable for injuries
that you may incur with your box joint jig</b>.


<h2>Some safety notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
It is important that the box joint jig be constructed of good quality birch plywood.
This is especially important for the floor of the jig.
<li>
To ensure rigidity under use, the guide bar must be made of steel.  The guide bar
must be fastened with countersink #8 machine screws (or similar sized metric screws) to
the floor of the jig.  This will ensure that guide bar will not come loose while
cutting large stock.
<li>
The jig should slide easily in the slot.  Make sure the guide bar fits snugly in the slot
and that the slot and guide bar are clean.  A drop of oil on either side of the guide bar
can help to ensure smooth motion.
<li>
Stock must be clamped to the jig using bar clamps.  Be sure to use good quality bar
clamps that are not prone to come loose spontaneously.
<li>
Only turn the crank when the jig is on the operator side of the saw blade.  Do not turn
the crank while making a cut or while forward of the saw blade.
